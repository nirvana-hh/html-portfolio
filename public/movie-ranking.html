<h1>The Best Movies According to Hui</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Turning Red</h3>
<p>Made by a female Canadian Chinese director, it thoroughly explored the typical Asian Chinese Mother-daughter relationship, but in a witty-bantty way.</p>
<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p> This is my favoratie movie. I love the beautiful pictures and soul-reaching music.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
    Really cool Si-fi moive.
    <br />
    Great plot and action design.
