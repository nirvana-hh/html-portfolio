<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a working holiday maker in Australia. Previously, I worked as a translator 
in China for about three years. However, I've always harbored a curiosity about the world 
beyond China, prompting my decision to come to Australia. Presently, I am eager to acquire 
new skills to enhance my marketability in the job market. Angela's Yu Web course caught my 
attention after receiving numerous recommendations, leading me to take the plunge and enroll.</p>

<p>My passion for reading and contemplation stems from the belief that books encapsulate 
  human wisdom that withstands the test of time. They serve as the shoulders of giants, 
  allowing me to identify blind spots that may impede my progress or discover valuable insights
  that I can leverage.</p>

  <p>Documentaries have become a significant interest of mine. While I found them dull as a child, 
  my perspective has evolved with age. I appreciate the authenticity of real people and real-life
  stories, often feeling a connection with individuals on the opposite side of the planet or 
  with a substantial age difference. I am particularly drawn to documentaries about the animal kingdom, 
  where I glean wisdom from Mother Nature regarding the food chain, survival of the fittest, 
  and the parallels with human society.</p>

<p>In the realm of sports and exercise, I derive great enjoyment from rock climbing. Beyond the 
  physical benefits, such as strengthening the shoulders, arms, and back, it offers a mentally 
  engaging experience akin to solving a puzzle. Rock climbing proves to be an excellent dual 
  xercise for both physical and mental well-being.</p>
